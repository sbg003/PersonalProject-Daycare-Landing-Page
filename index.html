            </div>

            <div class="about-p">
                <p>My name is Sarah Bennett. I'm currently a stay at home mom of two children, one school-age and one preschool. I use my home to provide part-time childcare based on gentle parenting techniques to the Rolesville/Wake Forest community.<br>

                    <br> I was previously a cancer-reserach scientist and project manager for over 14 years. I'm now providing an affordable, part-time, home daycare service to the Rolesville/Wake Forest area. <br>

                    <br>I have a B.S. Degree in Forensic Chemistry and have 14 years experience trying to find affordable and reliable childcare for my own children. As a scientist, my schedule would often change which would lead to having to find a new daycare for my new hours. I've had 11 daycares over the years, including licensed centers, licensed home daycares, unlicensed homes, craigslist ads, family members, and friends of friends. I know personally how important it is to find safe, quality childcare that works with your schedule.

            </div>

            <div class="looking-p">
                <p>I typically work with only one family at a time (up to 3 children) to ensure my hours remain flexible enough to adapt to your needs as they change. This also allows you to be flexible with your family's vacation time, if your pto at work is limited.<br>
                    <br>Ideally I work with families who need part-time care, either less than 5 days per week or less than 8hr per day. <br>
                    <br>I provide at-home childcare in my home only, as I need to be available when my school-ager gets on and off the school bus each day. I do not provide nanny care in your home. <br>
                    <br>Location is perfect for family located in Rolesville/Wake Forest/N Raleigh/Zebulon/Knightdale area. <br>
                    <br>Contact me to see if Roly Poly Home Daycare is the right fit for your family!

            <h2>Why Choose Home Daycare?</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="why-p">
            <p>Flexible hours that work for your schedule. I don't have a cutoff time for dropoffs/pickups like a daycare center would. <br>
                <br>Quiet, small group environment. Just your children, my toddler, and me! Compared to 18 kids and two teachers at a daycare center. <br>
                <br>Smaller group leads to more enriched learning each day. More conversations, more 1-on-1 instruction, and more attention! <br>
                <br>Continuity of care is ensured here, unlike at a daycare center with constant teacher turnover and shift changes. You and I will be able to communicate daily about nutrition, behavior, potty training, sleep, etc and easily track progress. <br>
                <br>Clean environment where children don't get sick often like at a daycare center, keeping your family safe and letting you save your pto for things that really matter to you!
